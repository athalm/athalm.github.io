                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>Growing up in Pune, India, I was always fascinated by technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. My early exposure to computers and programming set the foundation for my academic and career pursuits. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects and internships that have broadened my skill set and deepened my passion for software development.</p>
                    <p>One of my most memorable experiences was interning at Infosys, where I led a team of interns to develop a movie ticketing website, earning second place for our project. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and innovative thinking. It also reinforced my desire to create technology that makes a difference in people's lives.</p>
